# SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my SQL learning repository!  
I'm learning SQL step-by-step — from the basics to advanced topics — and documenting everything here.

## Contents

- `week-1/basic-sql.md` – SQL fundamentals, filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- `week-2/joins-and-grouping.md` – Joins, grouping, subqueries, and data manipulation (coming soon!)

## Practice SQL Files
- Sample queries and exercises included in `.sql` files under each week.

##  Why I Made This
To improve my SQL skills and help others who are learning as well.  
Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute!
